These two programs were written to allow me to update the Vsupercap shunt voltage of an LTC3350 Supercap management IC.
Talker 2 does the programming and Listener emulates the LTC3350 and responds appropriately. 
I've added the ability to change the slave address and register as well as the value that is written in the Talker2 program. 
I haven't added that sophistication to the Listener but it would be easy to lift some of the code out of Talker2 if needed.
